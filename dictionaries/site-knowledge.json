  "about": "Arman Ayva Personal Website Arman Ayva \u2013 Montreal Jazz Composer & Hobbyist \ud83c\udfb7 Where modern jazz meets cinematic storytelling. Arman Ayva is a Montreal-based composer whose sound merges the soul of classic jazz with the freedom of funk and the mysticism of world music. From Lens to Loops: A Storyboard of Sound Before I began composing jazz, my world was framed through a camera lens. As a photographer and amateur filmmaker, I spent years capturing visual stories. Today, I use those same visual instincts to storyboard with sound. The Montreal Fusion: Armenian Soul meets Jazz-Funk Based in the creative crossroads of Montreal, my music is a deeply personal exploration of heritage and rhythm. I bridge the warmth of Armenian folk motifs with the high-energy freedom of 1970s fusion and analog synth textures. A Studio-First Philosophy I am not a performing artist; I am a studio-focused hobbyist dedicated to the architecture of sound. By focusing exclusively on production within Apple Logic Pro, I prioritize the intricate layering of live bass and global percussion. Beyond Composing: Curating the Vibe Creation is only half the journey. As the curator of the 'Funky Jazz Mood Lifter' playlist on Spotify, I connect with hundreds of followers who share a passion for bass-heavy grooves. Ready to dive into the music?
