Modern web development has quietly crossed an important threshold: cost is no longer a blocker to quality.

I have just published a detailed breakdown of the exact workflow I used to build this site—a production-grade system using Next.js, Vercel, and AI, all for **$0**.

### In this article, I cover:
* **The $0 Stack:** How to use Next.js and Vercel to get enterprise speeds on a hobby budget.

* **API Integration:** How I connect Spotify and YouTube without exposing keys.
* **Media Optimization:** Solving the bandwidth limit problem with Cloudinary.
